# Foundations of Computer Science

Heard about this book because the authors recently won turing awards. I figured it's probably worth going through. The other book that will be interesting is the compiler book.

I'll mainly be implementing the exercises that look interesting and documenting any elegant definitions or unique points from each chapter.

Note: Put this on hold until math becomes a roadblock.
