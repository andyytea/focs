# Computer Science: The Mechanization of Abstraction

- CS is the **science** of abstraction - creating appropriate models for thinking about problems and devising the computational techniques to solve them.
- In 1992, CS was relatively new. Unlike other sciences, CS is less concerned with the universe as it is, but more concerned with creating abstractions of real world problems that can be understood by **both** the computer itself and its user.
