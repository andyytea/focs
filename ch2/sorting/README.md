# Sorting

To sort a list of n elements, we need to permute the elements of the list so that they appear in nondecreaseing order. 

By definition, a sorting algorithm takes as input an arbitrary list and produces as output a sorted list that is a permutation of the input.

[selection sort](selection_sort.c) - reads single digit numbers separated by any number of spaces or tabs, exits on newline '\n' or non-digits
